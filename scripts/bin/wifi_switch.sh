# switch wifi connections

# the wifi at home is bad in terms of dropping network connections all the time,
# so I use the hotspot on my phone to connect temporarily
# this switch will switch the wifi from home to phone and vice-versa

# find which network the laptop is connected to

# if it is home, look if the phone network is available

# if phone network is available, connect to it

# if phone network is connected, look if home network is available

# if home network is available, connect to it
